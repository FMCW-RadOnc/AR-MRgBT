## Normal Instructions

To run the AR HUD, run the following commands in command line:
- Navigate to the project directory via "cd C:\Brachy Code\AR-MRgBT"
- Activate the Python virtual environment via "brachy\Scripts\activate"
- Open "params.json" and confirm all of the parameters are set to acceptable values.
   - Read "params.txt" for an explanation on what each parameter does   
- Run the HUD via "python tracking_gui.py"

## Other Utilities

Besides the normal HUD, there are several other programs that could be useful when developing or troubleshooting.

### Run the HUD using random sensor data

To run a version of the HUD where instead of using real sensor data, fake sensor data is used instead, run "python gui_test.py" instead.

### Record data from the sensors to use it later

To collect sensor data for later, run "python tracking_recorder.py". To change where the data is saved, change line 16 of "tracking_recorder.py" to use a different
folder name. Running this code will not open the HUD, and it will run for 100 seconds or until it is stopped manually.

### Run the HUD using prerecorded data

To run a version of the HUD where instead of using live data, recorded sensor data is used instead, run "python tracking_gui_prerecorded.py". To change which data folder to use,
change line 16 of "tracking_gui_prerecorded.py" to use a different folder name. By default, data should update as quickly as it was recorded. If you instead want to increase or decrease
the playback speed, change line 15 of "tracking_gui_prerecorded.py" to use a different SLOW_DOWN_FACTOR (1.0 is real time, 10.0 is 10x slower than real time, and 0.1 is 10x faster than real time).

## Quick Note on Troubleshooting

If you cannot connect to the sensors, make sure that a persistent route is set in powershell. Use this command:
"route -p add 10.243.146.24 mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.182.1 IF 3"

3 refers to this interface:
3...00 1b 41 0a 0a 20 ......Intel(R) Ethernet Controller (3) I225-V

To check if the route exists run the command "route print".
